About
=====

Camarero is a very simple web server that requires no configuration to start.
This web server can only serve static pages. It's meant to be used for sharing
a folder through HTTP.

The web server is built on top of libsoup and glib. The executable is quite
small and should be powerful enough for sharing folders without too much
troubles.


Installation
=============

To install the web server make sure that you have all the dependencies:
    - libsoup-2.4

Then simply do:

    make

The executable camarero should be present in the current folder and can be used.
